# Standalone directory

As of 12th November 2023, I have found some websites which might facilitate my thirst to push myself.

## What is the plan now...

This directory will be divided into further sub-directory to help me keep track of the questions
from the specific website. Tis but a very fortunate thing, I must say...

### What are the websites btw?

Glad you asked!(prolly), they are:

```
* [x] [Sir Adrian's Simple Programming Questions](https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html)
* [] [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives)
* [] [Sir John Dalby's Assignments](https://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/103/Projects/ProgrammingPractice.html)
```

There are more, but right now, I will try going through these, if you are interested in the others, please scroll down
in Sir Adrian's Simple Programming Questions.

Thanks and have a nice day hehe.
