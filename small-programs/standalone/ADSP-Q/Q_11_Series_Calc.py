# Write a program that computes the sum of an alternating series where each element of the series is
# an expression of the form ((âˆ’1)k+1)/(2\*kâˆ’1) for each value of k from 1 to a million, multiplied by 4.
# Or, in more mathematical notation


# NOTE: The value is close to pi, that is till two decimal places. I have rechecked it to see if I did
# anything wrong, but I cannot find any issue. Still, pi at the end, is still a pi(e)....hehe get it?
