# Private Repository

This repository is aimed to track my progress,
and also act as a storage site.

# Contribution

I don't know who will come across this
repository. Given that you are reading this,
please understand that I am very much new to Git
and I am digesting things one at a time...

Also, this is my personal repo, so I don't know in what
scenario shall I allow such.

TL:DR -> **This Repo is _not_ accepting _any_ contriubution for the time being.**

# Thanks :heartpulse:

Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this.
You are awesome! :metal:
